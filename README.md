## Purpose
Nudge is an app that aims to assist in creating spontaneous hangouts or meetings for you! On most social media apps, you may see that your friends are currently active in the app, but they could be doing all sorts of different things on the app, such as just responding to another friend's message or scrolling through the app out of boredom. They could be currently working, in the middle of a lecture, or absolutely free and you can't really tell unless you message them and ask. Nudge aims to resolve this by giving you a platform to see friends that are available to hang out immediately! Should you want to leave it to your friends to nudge you, you can simply use a Widget on your iPhone or use the Apple Watch app to switch your status to available. If you want to reach out, you can send a nudge to those who are also online! If you only want to hang out with a specific group of friends, you can selectively nudge them by using the Group function!

## Use Cases
### Case 1: Dokja and Sooyoung, university students
Dokja is a University Student studying on the same campus as Sooyoung. They became friends last semester having taken the same course together, but this semester they don't share any courses together. One day, Dokja finishes his lecture and has a two hour gap inbetween the next lecture, and has nothing else to do. Bored, and unsure whether anyone else is free, Dokja opens Nudge and sets his status to Online, letting his friends on the app see that Dokja is free to hang out. While he's now online on Nudge, he notices that Sooyoung is also online. He decides to send a nudge to Sooyoung, alerting her that he's also free to hang out. Sooyoung gets a notification on her phone, and she texts Dokja knowing both of them are available to meet to determine a place to meet. After deciding on a location, they both turn their status back to offline.

### Case 2: Junghyeok, an indoors user
Junghyeok is working from home, and has just finished his shift. He decides that he wants to play some video games now that work is over, and is looking to see whether any of his gaming friends are free. Junghyeok opens Nudge, and decides to set his status to Online only to his gaming friends, which he created a category on Nudge for. All his currently online friends in the gaming category automatically received a nudge from Junghyeok, and together they join a voice call to decide what game to play.

### Case 3: Hakhyun, Yerin, and Eunyu, users in close proximity of each other
Hakhyun has just finished an errand in Richmond, and is now looking to hang out with someone nearby. He opens Nudge and decides to nudge any of his friends who are nearby in a 5km radius. Eunyu, who is strolling around nearby window shopping, recieves the nudge and decides to meet up with Hakhyun, who texts her that he's 15 minutes away from where she's shopping. Hakhyun decides to leave his status as online as he's heading towards Eunyu, when Yerin also responds to Hakhyun's nudge. Hakhyun texts Yerin that he's going shopping with Eunyu, and extends an invite to Yerin, who also starts to head over. As the three meet up to shop, two more friends who were nudged join, and they decide to get dinner as a group.
